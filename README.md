# **BMI CALCULATOR** 
***BMI Calculator application using the ReactJS framework. A BMI calculator determines the relationship between a person’s height and weight. It provides a numerical value that categorizes the individual as underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese.***

# *Technologies Used/Pre-requisites*
* ReactJS
* CSS
* JSX
* Function Components in React

# ***Approach***
1. Create a new React app using npx create-react-app bmi-calculator. <br/>
2. Create a new file named BmiCalculator.js in the src directory. <br/>
3. Use a functional component for the BMI calculator. <br/>
4. We will Use React’s useState to handle input values (height, weight), the calculated BMI, and the BMI category. <br/>
5. Convert height from centimeters to meters and apply the BMI formula: BMI = weight / (height * height). <br/>
6. Set the BMI state with the calculated value. <br/>
7. Determine BMI categories (e.g., Underweight, Normal weight, Overweight, Obesity) based on the calculated BMI. <br/>
8. Display the BMI result and category. <br/>

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
